Things we need:
 - Deal with empty file -> "EOF while parsing a value" error

 - Deserialize Vec elements individually
    -> Currently unused, delete it?

 - Fallback for untagged enums with multiple fields like Program?
    -> Probably fine without for now
 - Parse from CLI options? Should this be part of the lib?
    -> Nah
