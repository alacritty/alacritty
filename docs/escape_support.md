# Escape Sequence Support

This list includes all escape sequences Alacritty currently supports.

### Legend

The available statuses are `PARTIAL`, `IMPLEMENTED` and `REJECTED`. While a
status of `PARTIAL` means there is still work left to be done, a status of
`IMPLEMENTED` for something partially implemented means all other features were
rejected.

All whitespace in escape sequences is solely for formatting purposes and all
relevant spaces are denoted as `SP`. The escape parameters are omitted for
brevity.
