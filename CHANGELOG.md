## Version 0.2.1

### Added

- Implement the `hidden` escape sequence (`echo -e "\e[8mTEST"`)
- Add support for macOS systemwide dark mode
- Set the environment variable `COLORTERM="truecolor"` to advertise 24-bit color support
- On macOS, there are two new values for the config option `window.decorations`:
    - `transparent` - This makes the title bar transparent and allows the
        viewport to extend to the top of the window.
    - `buttonless` - Similar to transparent but also removed the buttons.
- Add support for changing the colors from 16 to 256 in the `indexed_colors` config section

- Reduce memory usage significantly by only initializing part of the scrollback buffer at startup
- The `alacritty` terminfo entry no longer requires the `xterm` definition to be

  available, otherwise the `xterm-256color` entry is used instead

### Removed

- The terminfo entry `alacritty-256color`. It is replaced by the `alacritty`
  entry (which also advertises 256 colors)

### Fixed

- Rendering now occurs without the terminal locked which improves performance
- Clear screen properly before rendering of content to prevent various graphical glitches
- Fix build failure on 32-bit systems
- Windows started as unfocused now show the hollow cursor if the setting is enabled
- Empty lines in selections are now properly copied to the clipboard
- Selection start point lagging behind initial cursor position
- Rendering of selections which start above the visible area and end below it

### Deprecated

- The config option `window.decorations` should now use `full` or `none` instead
  of `true` or `false`, respectively.

### Security

## Version 0.2.0

- Pressing enter on the numpad should now insert a newline

- Add support for the bright foreground color

### Changed

- Multiple key/mouse bindings for a single key will now all be executed instead of picking one and
  ignoring the rest
