## [Unreleased]
### Added
- CHANGELOG has been added for documenting relevant user-facing changes
- Add `ClearHistory` key binding action and the `Erase Saved Lines` control sequence
- When growing the window height, Alacritty will now try to load additional lines out of the
  scrollback history
- Support the dim foreground color (`echo -e '\033[2mDimmed Text'`)
- Add support for the LCD-V pixel mode (vertical screens)
- Pressing enter on the numpad should now insert a newline
- The mouse bindings now support keyboard modifiers (shift/ctrl/alt/super)
- Add support for the bright foreground color
- Add a scrollback history buffer (10_000 lines by default)

### Changed
- Multiple key/mouse bindings for a single key will now all be executed instead of picking one and
  ignoring the rest
- Improve text scrolling performance (affects applications like `yes`, not scrolling the history)

### Fixed
- Clear the visible region when the RIS escape sequence (`echo -ne '\033c'`) is received
- Prevent logger from crashing Alacritty when stdout/stderr is not available
- Fix a crash when sending the IL escape sequence with a large number of lines
