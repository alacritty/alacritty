 - A lot of `+ 1isize` and shit, is there any way we can implement Eq/Ord/Add/Sub stuff without confusing the compiler here?
    -> Implement i32?
 - Implement Eq/Ord with usize?
 - Create a Point::new(usize, _) -> Point<Line>?
 - Add a function for (screen_lines() - 1) to Dimensions trait? "bottom_line"?
 - Double-check all the "stuff(usize) as isize" things once we can just directly use usize for compare/math/ord
 - Redo all the vi mode math, we might be able to simplify it (no more absolute?)
