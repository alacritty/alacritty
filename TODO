 - Figure out how to delete outdated errors
 - Figure out how to display the errors themselves
 - Think about moving the [X] to the first, not last line?

 DONE:
 - Switch from Arc<Mutex<_>> to channels with term as single owner for message bar
 - Fix issue with clicking in the message bar
 - Allow clicking on [X] to close message bar
 - Put log path into $ALACRITTY_LOG and tell user where that is
 - Move alacritty::Rgb to separate file
 - Render multi-line errors (and render full errors instead of path to log)
 - Check for persistent logging again before dropping log file
