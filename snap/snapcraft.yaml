summary: Modern, GPU accelerated terminal emulator
description: |
  Alacritty is the fastest terminal emulator in existence. Using the GPU
  for rendering enables optimizations that simply aren't possible in
  other emulators.

  Alacritty is focused on simplicity and performance. The performance
  goal means it should be faster than any other terminal emulator
  available. The simplicity goal means that it doesn't have features
  such as tabs or splits (which can be better provided by a window
  manager or terminal multiplexer) nor niceties like a GUI config editor.
  
  The software is considered to be at an alpha level of readinessâ€”there 
  are missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by 
  many as a daily driver.
