Please make sure to document all user-facing changes in the
`CHANGELOG.md` file.

If support for a new escape sequence was added, it should be documented
in `./docs/escape_support.md`.

Draft PRs are always welcome, though unless otherwise requested PRs will
not be reviewed until all required and optional CI steps are successful
and they have left the draft stage.
