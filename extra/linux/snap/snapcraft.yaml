version: '0.3.1'
summary: Modern, GPU accelerated terminal emulator
description: |
  Alacritty is a terminal emulator with a strong focus on simplicity and
  performance. With such a strong focus on performance, included features are
  carefully considered and you can always expect Alacritty to be blazingly fast.
  By making sane choices for defaults, Alacritty requires no additional setup.
  However, it does allow [configuration](#configuration) of many aspects of the
  terminal.

  The software is considered to be at a **beta** level of readiness -- there are
  a few missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as
  a daily driver.
