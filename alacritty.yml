# WinPTY backend (Windows only)
#
# Alacritty defaults to using the newer ConPTY backend if it is available,
# since it resolves a lot of bugs and is quite a bit faster. If it is not
# available, the WinPTY backend will be used instead.
#
# Setting this option to `true` makes Alacritty use the legacy WinPTY backend,
# even if the ConPTY backend is available.
#winpty_backend: false

# Send ESC (\x1b) before characters when alt is pressed.
#alt_send_esc: true

#mouse:
  # Click settings
  #
  # The `double_click` and `triple_click` settings control the time
  # alacritty should wait for accepting multiple clicks as one double
  # or triple click.
  #double_click: { threshold: 300 }
  #triple_click: { threshold: 300 }

  # If this is `true`, the cursor is temporarily hidden when typing.
  #hide_when_typing: false

  #url:
    # URL launcher
    #
    # This program is executed when clicking on a text which is recognized as a URL.
    # The URL is always added to the command as the last parameter.
    #
    # When set to `launcher: None`, URL launching will be disabled completely.
    #
    # Default:
    #   - (macOS) open
    #   - (Linux/BSD) xdg-open
    #   - (Windows) explorer
    #launcher:
    #  program: xdg-open
    #  args: []

    # URL modifiers
    #
    # These are the modifiers that need to be held down for opening URLs when clicking
    # on them. The available modifiers are documented in the key binding section.
    #modifiers: None

# Mouse bindings
#
# Mouse bindings are specified as a list of objects, much like the key
# bindings further below.
#
# To trigger mouse bindings when an application running within Alacritty captures the mouse, the
# `Shift` modifier is automatically added as a requirement.
#
# Each mouse binding will specify a:
#
# - `mouse`:
#
#   - Middle
#   - Left
#   - Right
#   - Numeric identifier such as `5`
#
# - `action` (see key bindings)
#
# And optionally:
#
# - `mods` (see key bindings)
#mouse_bindings:
#  - { mouse: Middle, action: PasteSelection }

# Key bindings
#
# Key bindings are specified as a list of objects. For example, this is the
# default paste binding:
#
# `- { key: V, mods: Control|Shift, action: Paste }`
#
# Each key binding will specify a:
#
# - `key`: Identifier of the key pressed
#
#    - A-Z
#    - F1-F24
#    - Key0-Key9
#
#    A full list with available key codes can be found here:
#    https://docs.rs/glutin/*/glutin/event/enum.VirtualKeyCode.html#variants
#
#    Instead of using the name of the keys, the `key` field also supports using
#    the scancode of the desired key. Scancodes have to be specified as a
#    decimal number. This command will allow you to display the hex scancodes
#    for certain keys:
#
#       `showkey --scancodes`.
#
# Then exactly one of:
#
# - `chars`: Send a byte sequence to the running application
#
#    The `chars` field writes the specified string to the terminal. This makes
#    it possible to pass escape sequences. To find escape codes for bindings
#    like `PageUp` (`"\x1b[5~"`), you can run the command `showkey -a` outside
#    of tmux. Note that applications use terminfo to map escape sequences back
#    to keys. It is therefore required to update the terminfo when changing an
#    escape sequence.
#
# - `action`: Execute a predefined action
#
#   - ToggleViMode
#   - SearchForward
#       Start searching toward the right of the search origin.
#   - SearchBackward
#       Start searching toward the left of the search origin.
#   - Copy
#   - Paste
#   - IncreaseFontSize

#   - ScrollLineUp
#   - ScrollLineDown
#   - ScrollToTop
#   - ScrollToBottom
#   - ClearHistory
#       Remove the terminal's scrollback history.
#   - Hide
#       Hide the Alacritty window.
#   - Minimize
#       Minimize the Alacritty window.
#   - Quit
#       Quit Alacritty.
#   - ToggleFullscreen
#   - SpawnNewInstance
#       Spawn a new instance of Alacritty.
#   - ClearLogNotice
#       Clear Alacritty's UI warning and error notice.
#   - ClearSelection
#       Remove the active selection.
#   - ReceiveChar
#   - None
#
#   (`mode: Vi` only):
#   - Open
#       Open URLs at the cursor location with the launcher configured in `url.launcher`.
#   - Up
#       Move the vi mode cursor up by one line.
#   - Down
#       Move the vi mode cursor down by one line.
#   - Left
#       Move the vi mode cursor left by one character.
#   - Right
#       Move the vi mode cursor right by one character.
#   - First
#       Move the vi mode cursor to the start of the line, searching across newlines if it is already at the beginning.
#   - Last
#       Move the vi mode cursor to the end of the line, searching across newlines if it is already at the end.
#   - FirstOccupied
#       Move the vi mode cursor to the first non-empty cell in this line, searching across newlines if it is already at the first one.
#   - High
#       Move the vi mode cursor to the top of the screen.
#   - Middle
#       Move the vi mode cursor to the middle of the screen.
#   - Low
#       Move the vi mode cursor to the bottom of the screen.
#   - SemanticLeft
#       Move the vi mode cursor to the start of the previous semantically separated word.
#   - SemanticRight
#       Move the vi mode cursor to the start of the next semantically separated word.
#   - SemanticLeftEnd
#       Move the vi mode cursor to the end of the previous semantically separated word.
#   - SemanticRightEnd
#       Move the vi mode cursor to the end of the next semantically separated word.
#   - WordLeft
#       Move the vi mode cursor to the start of the previous whitespace separated word.
#   - WordRight
#       Move the vi mode cursor to the start of the next whitespace separated word.
#   - WordLeftEnd
#       Move the vi mode cursor to the end of the previous whitespace separated word.
#   - WordRightEnd
#       Move the vi mode cursor to the end of the next whitespace separated word.
#   - Bracket
#       Move the vi mode cursor to the next character that matches the bracket at the cursor's
#       current location.
#   - ToggleNormalSelection
#   - ToggleLineSelection
#   - ToggleBlockSelection
#   - ToggleSemanticSelection
#       Toggle semantic selection based on `selection.semantic_escape_chars`.
#   - SearchNext
#       Jump to the beginning of the next match.
#   - SearchPrevious
#       Jump to the beginning of the previous match.
#   - SearchStart
#       Jump to the next start of a match to the left of the vi mode cursor.
#   - SearchEnd
#       Jump to the next end of a match to the left of the vi mode cursor.
#
#   (macOS only):
#   - ToggleSimpleFullscreen
#       Enter fullscreen without occupying another space.
#
#   (Linux/BSD only):
#   - CopySelection
#       Copy from the selection buffer.
#   - PasteSelection
#       Paste from the selection buffer.
#
# - `command`: Fork and execute a specified command plus arguments
#
#    The `command` field must be a map containing a `program` string and an
#    `args` array of command line parameter strings. For example:
#       `{ program: "alacritty", args: ["-e", "vttest"] }`
#
# And optionally:
#
# - `mods`: Key modifiers to filter binding actions
#
#    - Command
#    - Control
#    - Option
#    - Super
#    - Shift
#    - Alt
#
#    Multiple `mods` can be combined using `|` like this:
#       `mods: Control|Shift`.
#    Whitespace and capitalization are relevant and must match the example.
#
# - `mode`: Indicate a binding for only specific terminal reported modes
#
#    This is mainly used to send applications the correct escape sequences
#    when in different modes.
#
#    - AppCursor
#    - AppKeypad
#    - Alt
#    - Vi
#
#    A `~` operator can be used before a mode to apply the binding whenever
#    the mode is *not* active, e.g. `~Alt`.
#
# Bindings are always filled by default, but will be replaced when a new
# binding with the same triggers is defined. To unset a default binding, it can
# be mapped to the `ReceiveChar` action. Alternatively, you can use `None` for
# a no-op if you do not wish to receive input characters for that binding.
#
# If the same trigger is assigned to multiple actions, all of them are executed
# in the order they were defined in.
